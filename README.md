## Session based messaging for page-to-page alerts and notifications

The `Message` class provides a simple way to set messages (usually in a controller) and then retrieve them after a redirect or on another page.  This is useful when showing success and error messages, but can also be used for basic alerts or informational pieces that might be raised in some conditions and only shown in others across multiple requests.
